# Chrome Print - storage
# ==============================================================================
# This container provides some shared storage space for our other containers.
# Out of the box all communication is done via unix sockets not tcp.
# For smaller single host setups this should work fine. For larger deployments
# you may like to reconfigure the services to talk via TCP.
