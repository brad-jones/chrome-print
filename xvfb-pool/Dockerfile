# Chrome Print - xvfb-pool
# ==============================================================================
# Because it takes a few seconds for Chrome to start and become ready to print
# PDF documents. This container managers a pool of xvfb containers much like
# nginx or php-fpm.

# Extend the php-fpm container
FROM bradjones/chrome-print-php-fpm

# Add our container files
ADD ["container-files","/"]

# Define some config for the pool manager
ENV START_WORKERS 5
ENV MAX_WORKERS 50
ENV MIN_SPARE_WORKERS 5
ENV MAX_SPARE_WORKERS 35

# Start our pool manager
CMD ["/usr/bin/php", "/var/www/html/pool.php"]
